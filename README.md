#FinTest

FinTest gets its name from my need of testing whether I could put together an equity ticker data scraper with Python. All it does is scrape the data from the Yahoo Finance database and compute some simple statistical indicators, then outputting a single scatterplot with some correlation coefficients.

## Usage

Run the script and follow the input indications. Frequency should be "day", "week" and so on, and it refers to ticker frequency to be computed.
